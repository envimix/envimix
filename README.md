# Envimix

### Warning. This is not a representative code. The goal was just to finish to project in some way so that players can enjoy Envimix Turbo finally. Refer to this just if you want to see how something works.

This repository contains all of the gamemodes, manialinks, and other scripts that make the new envimix gamemodes possible. It also contains some Envimix Turbo specific pieces, which should be eventually moved to a different repository.

The C# code is translated to ManiaScript, which is then for example compiled in the Envimix Turbo title pack. The translation is done using [ManiaScriptSharp](https://github.com/BigBang1112/maniascript-sharp).
